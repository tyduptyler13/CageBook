Funny script for changing all the profile pictures on Facebook to Nicolas Cage.


Notes
----
The pictures are not included on the git and are only available from the store or my private download link below.

Download
----
[Google webstore](http://adf.ly/Pnnbo) (Automatic updates)

[Direct download](http://adf.ly/2843532/cagebook-direct) (It won't update automatically)

To install the direct download you will need to open your extensions directory [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
Now you must check developer mode. Finally drag and drop the crx file onto that window and it will install the plugin.
